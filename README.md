## Deployment/Forking/Cloning

### Deployment
I used Gitpod to develop the code and then pushed to Github.

Here are the following steps I used to deploy the website from Github repository to Github Pages.

1. Log in to Github and find the repository you wish to deploy.
2. At the top of the page, click on "Settings".
3. On the left hand side of the settings page, under Code and automation, click on "Pages".
4. From the source section drop-down menu, select the Main Branch.
5. Click Save.


### Forking

1. On GitHub.com, navigate to the octocat/Spoon-Knife repository.
2. In the top-right corner of the page, click Fork.
3. Under "Owner," select the dropdown menu and click an owner for the forked repository.
4. By default, forks are named the same as their upstream repositories. Optionally, to further distinguish your fork, in the "Repository name" field, type a name.
5. Optionally, in the "Description" field, type a description of your fork.
6. Optionally, select Copy the DEFAULT branch only. For many forking scenarios, such as contributing to open-source projects,
 you only need to copy the default branch. If you do not select this optionl all branches will be copied into the new fork.
7. Click Create fork.


### Cloning

1. On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository.
2. Above the list of files, click "Code".
3. Copy the URL for the repository.
  - To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "HTTPS", click .
  - To clone the repository using an SSH key, including a certificate issued by your organization's SSH certificate authority, click SSH, then click.
  -To clone a repository using GitHub CLI, click GitHub CLI, then click.
4. Open Git Bash.
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.
6. Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied earlier. _git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY_
7. Press Enter to create your local clone.
